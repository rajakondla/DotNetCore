If we want to have a resuable component, then we should use ViewComponent introduced in Asp.net core

1) We can use partial view for this. But partial view should not have any business logic involved
2) We can write business logic in controller, but it is not reusable
3) We can use child action method, but child action method involves in complete lifecycle of controller which leads to performance issue. Each child action method has its corresponding view

View components is like a patial view with its own mini lightweight controller. Can be used if complex business logic or calculation is involved. Can be rendered using razor syntax.

MVC expects view components class in ViewComponent folder, and its view in Component/{component name}/ folder any view name.
